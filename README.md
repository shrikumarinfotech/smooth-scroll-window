# jQuery Smooth Scroll Window
A jQuery plugin to scroll any `anchor` link with ease effect.

# Usage

Load these `scripts` before the `</body>` of your `HTML` file or app
```
<script src="jquery-3.5.1.min.js"></script>
<script src="smooth-scroll-window-v1.0.0.js"></script>
```

In your `script.js` file call the function as follows:
```
$(this).smoothScrollWindow();
```

Note: This will only function for `anchor` links with `#` prefixed values. When the link is only `#` it will go to top of the page.
